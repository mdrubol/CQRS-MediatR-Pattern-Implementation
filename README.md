# Clean Architecture : CQRS-MediatR Pattern Implementation


CQRS

CQRS stands for Command and Query Responsibility Segregation and uses to separate read(queries) and write(commands).
In that, queries perform read operation, and command perform writes operation like create, update, delete, and return data.

MediatR

MediatR pattern helps to reduce direct dependency between multiple objects and make them collaborative through MediatR.
